                  <h4>Angalabiri Federated Community was founded over 200 years ago before 1815 AD</h4>
                  <p>
                    It was founded by AKOU the son of Angalabiriowei and the grandson of Tarakiriowei.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    AKOU was a hunter/fisherman who migrated from Ubioma in present Southern-Ijaw LGA of Bayelsa State.
                    He first settled at Uwubulou (opposite present Amatolo) after a misunderstanding amongst
                    Tarakiriowei sons over food. The Angalabiri kindred also settled at the present location of Amatolo
                    before moving to Edeinpou on the shores of River Forcados estuary (near present Delta State
                    Angiama).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thereafter, the Angalabiri kindred negotiated for its present location with Zado, son of Mein and
                    the founder of Oboro Community in present Delta State. Fortunately, Zado was a lone settler far away
                    from his Mein kindred so he was willing to leave the land and return to his father’s domain i.e. the
                    present location of Oboro. Thus, Zado sold the land to the Angalabiri kindred through
                    trade-by-barter. Initially, Angalabiri Federated Community settled with four quarters viz:
                    Ozigbopelei, Aramabiri, Olodiamapelei and Agbeinware. It later expanded to five quarters with the
                    creation of Guaware. The five quarters further developed to federating units as communities viz;
                    Ozibgo-ama, Aran-ama, Olodiama, Agbein-ama and Gua-ama, making the modern Angalabiri Federated
                    Community with an indigenous population of over ten thousand people. <br>
                    Earlier, there was an unbridled culture of idol-worshipping amongst the sons of AKOU Angalabiriowei,
                    as the discovery of the Eperetua Deity by AKOU, the founder of Angalabiri Federated Community was
                    the precursor to the discovery of the land, Eperetuabou (Epiritua Bush) and the attendant final
                    relocation/settlement of the community at its present location. History has it that earlier Chief
                    Priests of Eperetua were buried at Owubulou (opposite Amatolo) according to customs\tradition. It
                    was said that Saisai, Enewarikemieye, etc were among Chief Priests of Eperetua that were buried at
                    Owubulou. The first Chief Priest that was buried at the present location of Angalabiri was
                    Kuro-Orulagha Ebakpa.

                  <p>
                    The Amananaowei of Angalabiri is greeted as: “AKOU!, AKOU!!, AKOU!!!, Datimi Ondu (Long live the
                    Paramount Ruler)”. The Angalabiri traditional stool started with Boubaikeburu Mieyeseigha as the
                    first Amananaowei that was traditionally recognized. He reigned from 1937 till his death in 1971.
                    Thereafter, the stool was vacant till 2004, when Alex Youbogha became the Amananaowei. He was the
                    first to be recognized and documented in the Gazette of Bayelsa State Government as AKOU I HRH Alex
                    Youbogha also joined his ancestors in 2016, which made the Amananaowei stool vacant, again. Please

                    It is worthy to note that Angalabiri Federated Community has passed through a lot of crises in the
                    practice of its traditional institution over the years. We are hoping that God will put all that
                    behind us now and recreate a divine and united traditional stool to put the community on the fastest
                    lane of development.

                  <h4>Angalabiri Federated Community operates a written Constitution that was first enacted in 1989</h4>
                  <p>
                    Prior to 1989, the Community was operating an unwritten pre-colonial Constitution based on
                    historical facts and its traditional values. The Angalabiri constitutional development has witnessed
                    four major constitutional amendments viz: 1989 (amendment from unwritten to written constitution),
                    2004 (amendment of the 1989 Constitution), and 2015 (amendment of the 2004 Constitution). It was the
                    2015 amendment that recognized five quarters as federating units (communities) and eventually
                    declared Angalabiri a Federated Community (See S.2 of the Constitution as Amended). The 2015
                    Constitution as Amended also reviewed the tenure of Amananaowei and the Title Chiefs from three
                    years to life.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Angalabiri Federated Community also has a recognized Community Development Committee (CDC), headed
                    by a Chairman and EXCO Members. The Constitution allows one-year tenure for the CDC. The 2015
                    Constitution as Amended further provides Statutory Development Committees on the following areas:
                    (i) Education, (ii) Health, (iii) Festival, (iv) Funeral, (v) Electric Power/Water Supply (Utility),
                    (vi) Town Planning, and (vii) Market. The Constitution allows two-year tenure for all Statutory
                    Development Committees.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The 2019 constitution (amendment of 2015 constitution) has provided specific requirements for the
                    removal of the CDC Chairman and Members. This has laid to rest the babaric approach of any aggrieved
                    group proclaiming the community with a GONG announcing the dethronement of a CDC Chairman at the
                    slightest provocation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Angalabiri people has two renowned annual festivals viz: the Aburubele Oge whereby epic
                    masquerades like Eperitua, Fiyaifikakuro and others featured prominently; and the Abobulu (Island)
                    Fishing Festival which is predominantly celebrated in April every year. Angalabiri Federated
                    Community is also blessed with music (a.k.a Congo City). It has produced an amazing number of Ijaw
                    musicians such as the Late Legend, the Numoupere of Ijaw, King (Dr) Robert Ebizimor, Late Bestman
                    Doupere, SAN A.S. Eseduwo, Anthony Cockson, Peanock Fukurumo, DKC Lagos, Newman Zink, Late Fine
                    Dieware, Princess Diana, Kente Bekeyei, etc. Angalabiri Federated Community has enjoyed peaceful
                    co-existence with its neighbouring communities over the years, e.g. Ofoni, Adobu, Toru-Orua,
                    Bulou-Orua, Ebedebiri, Angiama, etc.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The late legend <b>King(Dr) Robert Ebizimor</b> is celebrated every year on <b>31st July</b> whereby
                    all the IZON musicians gather for live performance by way of reaffirming their talents. This is also
                    another canival in angalabiri federated community that attracts tourists from all over the world.

                    The community is located by the <b>River Forcados</b>, overlooking the age-long ABOBULU island,
                    which serves tripple purpose of fishing,
                    farming and eco-green environment.

                  <p>
                    The River Forcados can also serve as a source for Hydro Energy generation.

                  <p>
                    With fishing lakes like Abobulu, Dunoubou, Kalaboye, Tamowei, Ogbalabeni, Etoindunou, Bienmadanwain,
                    Torukubu, etc, our community engages majorly in the business of fishing.

                  <p>
                    The community is also blessed with other natural resources, such as gravel, sharp sand, timber, etc.
                    This largely explains the main occupations of the people of Angalabiri i.e farming, fishing,
                    hunting, local dredging, lumbering, and so on.

                  <p>
                    This is evidenced by the late establishment of the first Primary School in 1927, which was after
                    over One Hundred and Ten years of the existence of Angalabiri Federated Community. Please see

                  <p>
                    This has adversely affected the human and infrastructural development of the Community, largely.
                    However, Angalabiri Federated Community is one of the fast developing communities in the Sagbama LGA
                    of Bayelsa State, presently.

                  <p>
                    The Community has been actively participating in the political activities of the area right from the
                    days of districts to Sagbama LGA, Bayelsa State and national level. Angalabiri Federated Community
                    has produced notable politicians such as Late Chief Gordon Bozimo, Late Paul Esewe, Late Chief

                  <h4>Angalabiri Federated Community has embraced Christianity to a large extent </h4>
                  <p>
                    With great men of God like Pastor Francis Micah of the Christ Harbour Ministry, Pst. Ebimobowei
                    Surveyor (PFN Chairman, Angalabiri), Jonathan Hausa of the Cherubim & Seraphim Church, Late O.K.
                    Nanatu, etc. and quite a number of churches have established their branches in Angalabiri. Thus,
                    Christianity has started opening up the Community for development.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The history of Angalabiri has been largely oral and this has also affected the development of the
                    Community negatively, as most discoveries in science and technology were earlier uncultivated, and
                    as such, affected the development of the Angalabiri Federated Community. This, the present
                    Amananaowei of Angalabiri Federated Community, HRH (Dr) Famous S. Eseduwo has fixed and ensuring its
                    sustainability.
